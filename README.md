### Allows you to:
- [x] How many times to try
- [x] Time interval between attempts in seconds
- [x] Next attempt will always take more time then the previous one if set

- If the request timed out, you usually have to call the request again by yourself. **AFNetworking+RetryPolicy** handles that for you.
 
- **AFNetworking+RetryPolicy category** adds the ability to set the retry interval, retry count and progressive (uses power rule e.g. interval = 3 -> 3, 9, 27 etc.). `failure` is called no earlier then `retryCount` = 0, only `fatalStatusCodes` finishes the request earlier.

## Installation
**Category requires [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) 3.0 and above**

- Add the **AFNetworking+RetryPolicy** category to your project as a regular library.

## Usage
- E.g. Simple `GET` request will look like this.

```objective-c
	AFHTTPSessionManager *manager = [AFHTTPSessionManager new];
    [manager GET:@"foo" parameters:nil progress:nil success:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, id responseObject) {
        NSLog(@"%@", responseObject);
        
    } failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
        NSLog(@"%@", error.localizedDescription);
        
    } retryCount:5 retryInterval:2.0 progressive:false fatalStatusCodes:@[@401, @403]];
```

- You can also turn on the logging in the category to see what happens.
